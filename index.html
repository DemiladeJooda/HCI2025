      <h2> Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
      <p>Uncertainty Communication for Decision-making (Spring 25)</p>
      <p>Time: MW 2:30pm - 3:45pm, Location: CS 5000<br>
      Last update: 01/15/2025 10:00</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This course covers Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research topics focusing on model uncertainty and decision-making. We will cover a range of models, from linear regression to probabilistic forecasts and AI foundation models, and explore how to help human users understand and manage uncertainty in these computational models. Core topics include statistical communication, explainability, decision-making, uncertainty visualization, and LLM uncertainty. This course is MS/PhD qualifying in Software Engineering/Programming Languages/HCI. The class format includes a combination of presentations, discussions, and lectures.</p>

      <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe the background and open problems within the covered topics.</li>
        <li>Propose new research projects based on the learned topics.</li>
        <li>Choose and justify appropriate HCI research methods for their projects.</li>
        <li>Understand the peer-reviewing process in HCI.</li>
        <li>Improve their communication and presentation skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This course is ideal for first or second-year graduate students. Senior PhD students interested in these topics are also welcome.</p>

      <h3>How Things Work</h3>
      <p>We combine conventional activities (presentations, discussions, projects) with experimental ones (peer-reviewing). Canvas will be used for class communication and finding collaborators. Unless specified otherwise, submit assignments through Canvas. Course materials will also be synced on Canvas.</p>
      <p>Useful links: Canvas. You can find the presentation signup on Canvas under the corresponding assignment.</p>
